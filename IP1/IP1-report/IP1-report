## Task 1 - Theory
### A) Explain in one sentence what sampling is
Sampling is the process of collecting data from sources such as images, photographs or videos.
### B) Explain in one sentence what quantization is
Quantization refers to a techinque used to compress a range of values into a single quantum.
### C) Looking at an image histogram, how can you see that the image has high contrast
When looking at a histogram, high contrast is characterized by a wide distribution of pixel values. The histogram will often show distinct peaks and valleys.
### D) Perform histogram requalization by hand:

### E) What happens to the dynamic range if we apply a log transform to an image with large variance in pixel intensities?i
When applying a log transform to an image with a large variation in pixel intensities the dynamic range is reduced. This means it enchances details in darker areas but may lose some details in very bright regions
### F) Perform spatial convolution by hand:
